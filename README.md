# probabilit

A small Python package for Monte Carlo modeling.

- User friendly API with a modeling language.
- Built on scipy and numpy.
- Supports composite distributions (e.g. mean of a distribution can be a distribution).
- Supports Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, e.g. Sobol, Halton and LHS.
- Supports inducing correlations with Iman-Conover.

## Modeling

The modeling API creates lets you create a computational graph, where each node is a distribution, a constant or some transformation.
Once the method `.sample()` is called on a node, each ancestor node is sampled in turn.

**Example 1 - Height.**
For instance, what is the probability that a man is taller than a woman?

```pycon
>>> from probabilit.modeling import Distribution
>>> male_height = Distribution("norm", loc=176, scale=7.1)
>>> female_height = Distribution("norm", loc=162.5, scale=7.1)
>>> statistic = (male_height > female_height)
>>> samples = statistic.sample(999, random_state=0)
>>> samples.mean()
np.float64(0.9039039039039038)

```

When `statistic` is sampled in the code above, the ancestor nodes `male_height` and `female_height` are sampled too.
In each node, results are stored in the `samples_` attribute.

```pycon
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> pd.Series(male_height.samples_).describe()
count    999.000000
mean     176.096916
std        7.326152
min      153.210671
25%      171.209087
50%      176.044660
75%      180.948085
max      201.216617
dtype: float64

```


**Example 2 - Bird survival.**
Here is another example illustrating _composite distributions_, where the argument
to one distribution is another distribution.
Suppose we have a distribution governing the number off eggs per bird nest for a certain species, and a survival probability.
What is the distribution of the number of birds that survive per nest?

```pycon
>>> eggs_per_nest = Distribution("poisson", mu=3)
>>> survivial_prob = 0.4
>>> survived = Distribution("binom", n=eggs_per_nest, p=survivial_prob)
>>> survived.sample(9, random_state=0) # Sample a few values only
array([2., 1., 1., 2., 2., 2., 2., 0., 0.])

```

**Example 3 - Mutual fund.**
Suppose you save 1200 units of money per year and that the yearly interest rate has a distribution `N(1.11, 0.15)`.
How much money will you have over a 20 year horizon?

```pycon
>>> saved_per_year = 1200
>>> returns = 0
>>> for year in range(20):
...     interest = Distribution("norm", loc=1.11, scale=0.15)
...     returns = returns * interest + saved_per_year
>>> samples = returns.sample(999, random_state=42)
>>> samples.mean(), samples.std()
(np.float64(76583.58738496085), np.float64(33483.2245611436))

```

## Low-level API

The low-level API contains Numpy functions for working with random variables.
The two most important ones are (1) the `nearest_correlation_matrix` function and and (2) the `ImanConover` class.

**Fixing user-supplied correlation matrices.**
The function `nearest_correlation_matrix` can be used to fix user-specified correlation matrices, which are often not valid.
Below a user has specified some correlations, but the resulting correlation matrix has a negative eigenvalue and is not positive definite.

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from probabilit.correlation import nearest_correlation_matrix
>>> X = np.array([[1, 0.9, 0],
...               [0.9, 1, 0.8],
...               [0, 0.8, 1]])
>>> np.linalg.eigvals(X) # Not a valid correlation matrix
array([-0.20415946,  1.        ,  2.20415946])
>>> nearest_correlation_matrix(X)
array([[1.        , 0.77523696, 0.07905637],
       [0.77523696, 1.        , 0.69097837],
       [0.07905637, 0.69097837, 1.        ]])
>>> np.linalg.eigvals(nearest_correlation_matrix(X))
array([2.07852823e+00, 9.21470108e-01, 1.66710188e-06])

```

**Inducing correlations on samples.**
The class `ImanConover` can be used to induce correlations on uncorrelated variables.
There's not guarantee that we're able to achieve the desired correlation structure, but in practice we can often get close.

```pycon
>>> import scipy as sp
>>> from probabilit.correlation import ImanConover
>>> sampler = sp.stats.qmc.LatinHypercube(d=2, seed=42, scramble=True)
>>> samples = sampler.random(n=100)
>>> X = np.vstack((sp.stats.triang(0.5).ppf(samples[:, 0]),
...                sp.stats.gamma.ppf(samples[:, 1], a=1))).T

```

Now we can induce correlations:

```pycon
>>> format(sp.stats.pearsonr(*X.T).statistic, ".8f")
'0.06589800'
>>> correlation_matrix = np.array([[1, 0.3], [0.3, 1]])
>>> transform = ImanConover().set_target(correlation_matrix)
>>> X_transformed = transform(X)
>>> format(sp.stats.pearsonr(*X_transformed.T).statistic, ".8f")
'0.27965287'

```
